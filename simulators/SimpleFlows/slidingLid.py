I have made the decission to not include anything form the tests 
or from the original code itself.
This module should be able to work on its own, but it will be with basically no explanation in the code itself
for this look at the simpleFlowsTest.

# Todo: remove me
'''
my todos:
implement the sliding lid 3 boundaries just as bounce back, 1 is sliding over it
needs streaming, collision, equilibrium, bounce back but more complicated
use streamplot for a visualization
could rework the bounce back to be more streamlined

# initial variables and sizes
size_x = 50
size_y = 50

# main methods

def sliding_lid():
    print("Sliding Lid")
